"Stability and Biotransformation of 6:2 Fluorotelomer Sulfonic Acid, Sulfonamide Amine Oxide, and Sulfonamide Alkylbetaine in Aerobic Sludge",2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c05506,"The 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide (6:2 FTSAm)-based compounds signify a prominent group of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) widely used in contemporary aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) formulations. Despite their widespread presence, the biotransformation behavior of these compounds in wastewater treatment plants remains uncertain. This study investigated the biotransformation of 6:2 FTSAm-based amine oxide (6:2 FTNO), alkylbetaine (6:2 FTAB), and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid (6:2 FTSA) in aerobic sludge over a 100-day incubation period. The biotransformation of 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonamide alkylamine (6:2 FTAA), a primary intermediate product of 6:2 FTNO, was indirectly assessed. Their stability was ranked based on the estimated half-lives (t1/2): 6:2 FTAB (no obvious products were detected) ? 6:2 FTSA (t1/2 ¡Ö28.8 days) > 6:2 FTAA (t1/2 ¡Ö11.5 days) > 6:2 FTNO (t1/2 ¡Ö1.2 days). Seven transformation products of 6:2 FTSA and 15 products of 6:2 FTNO were identified through nontarget and suspect screening using high-resolution mass spectrometry. The transformation pathways of 6:2 FTNO and 6:2 FTSA in aerobic sludge were proposed. Interestingly, 6:2 FTSAm was hardly hydrolyzed to 6:2 FTSA and further biotransformed to perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs). Furthermore, the novel pathways for the generation of perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) from 6:2 FTSA were revealed. ? 2024 American Chemical Society","Amines; Biotransformation; Fluorocarbons; Oxides; Sewage; Sulfonamides; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Bioconversion; Sulfur compounds; Wastewater treatment; aliphatic amine; amine oxide; carboxylic acid; sulfonamide; amine; fluorocarbon; fluorotelomer sulfonamidoalkyl betaines; fluorotelomer sulfonic acids; oxide; sulfonamide; 6:2 fluorotelomer sulphonamide; 6:2 fluorotelomer sulphonic acid; Aerobic sludge; Alkylbetaine; Amine oxides; Aqueous film forming foams; Aqueous film-forming foam; Biotransformation; Fluorotelomers; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Sulphonamides; Sulphonic acids; activated sludge; biotransformation; foam; incubation; wastewater treatment plant; aerobic sludge; Article; biodegradation; biotransformation; foam; incubation time; mass spectrometry; microbial community; microcosm; pharmacokinetics; waste water treatment plant; biotransformation; chemistry; metabolism; sewage; water pollutant; Mass spectrometry",
Heterogeneous Photodegradation Behavior of Liquid Crystal Monomers in Dust: Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship and Product Identification,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c04753,"The heterogeneous photodegradation behavior of liquid crystal monomers (LCMs) in standard dust (standard reference material, SRM 2583) and environmental dust was investigated. The measured photodegradation ratios for 23 LCMs in SRM and environmental dust in 12 h were 11.1 ¡À 1.8 to 23.2 ¡À 1.1% and 8.7 ¡À 0.5 to 24.0 ¡À 2.8%, respectively. The degradation behavior of different LCM compounds varied depending on their structural properties. A quantitative structure-activity relationship model for predicting the degradation ratio of LCMs in SRM dust was established, which revealed that the molecular descriptors related to molecular polarizability, electronegativity, and molecular mass were closely associated with LCMs¡¯ photodegradation. The photodegradation products of the LCM compound 4¡ä-propoxy-4-biphenylcarbonitrile (PBIPHCN) in dust, including ?OH oxidation, C-O bond cleavage, and ring-opening products, were identified by nontarget analysis, and the corresponding degradation pathways were suggested. Some of the identified products, such as 4¡ä-hydroxyethoxy-4-biphenylcarbonitrile, showed predicted toxicity (with an oral rat lethal dose of 50%) comparable to that of PBIPHCN. The half-lives of the studied LCMs in SRM dust were estimated at 32.2-82.5 h by fitting an exponential decay curve to the observed photodegradation data. The photodegradation mechanisms of LCMs in dust were revealed for the first time, enhancing the understanding of LCMs¡¯ environmental behavior and risks. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.",Animals; Dust; Liquid Crystals; Photolysis; Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship; Rats; Chemical bonds; Computational chemistry; Crystal structure; Curve fitting; Electronegativity; Liquid crystals; Monomers; alkylphenol; ammonium sulfate; mineral; monomer; organophosphate; Environmental fate; Liquid crystal monomers; Non-target analysis; Photo degradation; Photodegradation behavior; Photodegradation ratio; Product identification; QSAR; Quantitative structure activity relationship; Standard reference material; crystal structure; dust; environmental fate; photodegradation; quantitative analysis; Article; autocorrelation; chemical structure; control system; controlled study; correlation coefficient; cross validation; dealkylation; degradation; dust; environmental impact; heliotherapy; irradiation; isotherm; kinetic parameters; LD50; lethal dose; liquid crystal; mineral dust; molecular weight; multiple linear regression analysis; nonhuman; oxidation; particulate matter; photodegradation; photolysis; physical chemistry; polarization; quantitative analysis; quantitative structure activity relation; rat; rate constant; reaction time; retention time; ring opening; risk assessment; root mean squared error; uncertainty; volume; animal; dust; quantitative structure activity relation; Dust,
Maternal and Paternal Preconception Serum Concentrations of Per and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Relation to Birth Outcomes,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c07954,"Prenatal per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure is associated with adverse birth outcomes. There is an absence of evidence on the relationship between maternal and paternal preconception PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. This study included 312 mothers and 145 fathers with a singleton live birth from a preconception cohort of subfertile couples seeking fertility treatment at a U.S. clinic. PFAS were quantified in serum samples collected before conception. Gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW) were abstracted from delivery records. We also assessed low birthweight (BW < 2500 g) and preterm birth (GA < 37 completed weeks). We utilized multivariable linear regression, logistic regression, and quantile-based g computation to examine maternal or paternal serum concentrations of individual PFAS and mixture with birth outcomes. Maternal serum concentrations of perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS), and the total PFAS mixture were inversely associated with birthweight. Maternal PFOS concentration was associated with a higher risk of low birthweight. Conversely, paternal PFOS and PFHxS concentrations were imprecisely associated with higher birthweight. No associations were found for gestational age or preterm birth. The findings have important implications for preconception care. Future research with larger sample sizes would assist in validating these findings. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Alkanesulfonic Acids; Birth Weight; Environmental Pollutants; Fathers; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Male; Pregnancy; Premature Birth; Logistic regression; 2 (n methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido)acetate; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluoromethylheptanesulfonate; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Birthweight; Gestational age; Paternal; Perfluorooctane sulfonates; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Preconception; Preterm birth; Serum concentration; Serum samples; Singleton; age; fertility; health risk; pregnancy; serum; adult; Article; birth weight; blood level; controlled study; female; gestational age; human; infant; infertility therapy; low birth weight; major clinical study; male; pregnancy outcome; premature labor; prospective study; subfertility; United States; father; newborn; pollutant; pregnancy; prematurity; Multiple linear regression",
Comprehensive Characterization of Organic Light-Emitting Materials in Breast Milk by Target and Suspect Screening,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c08961,"Organic light-emitting materials (OLEMs) are emerging contaminants in the environment and have been detected in various environment samples. However, limited information is available regarding their contamination within the human body. Here, we developed a novel QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe) method coupled with triple quadrupole/high-resolution mass spectrometry to determine OLEMs in breast milk samples, employing both target and suspect screening strategies. Our analysis uncovered the presence of seven out of the 39 targeted OLEMs in breast milk samples, comprising five liquid crystal monomers and two OLEMs commonly used in organic light-emitting diode displays. The cumulative concentrations of the seven OLEMs in each breast milk sample ranged from ND to 1.67 ¡Á 103 ng/g lipid weight, with a mean and median concentration of 78.76 and 0.71 ng/g lipid weight, respectively, which were higher compared to that of typical organic pollutants such as polychlorinated biphenyls and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. We calculated the estimated daily intake (EDI) rates of OLEMs for infants aged 0-12 months, and the mean EDI rates during lactation were estimated to range from 30.37 to 54.89 ng/kg bw/day. Employing a suspect screening approach, we additionally identified 66 potential OLEMs, and two of them, cholesteryl hydrogen phthalate and cholesteryl benzoate, were further confirmed using pure reference standards. These two substances belong to cholesteric liquid crystal materials and raise concerns about potential endocrine-disrupting effects, as indicated by in silico predictive models. Overall, our present study established a robust method for the identification of OLEMs in breast milk samples, shedding light on their presence in the human body. These findings indicate human exposure to OLEMs that should be further investigated, including their health risks. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Environmental Pollutants; Female; Humans; Infant; Lipids; Mass Spectrometry; Milk, Human; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Cholesteric liquid crystals; Mass spectrometry; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Screening; benzoic acid; hydrogen; lipid; monomer; polybrominated diphenyl ether; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated biphenyl; Breast milk; Breast milk samples; Emerging contaminant; Estimated daily intakes; High resolution mass spectrometry; Human bodies; Intake rate; Liquid crystal materials; Organic light-emitting materials; Target and suspect screening; crystal structure; hydrogen; lactation; lipid; mass spectrometry; milk; phthalate; pollutant source; Article; breast milk; computer model; concentration (parameter); controlled study; estimated daily intake; human; lactation; liquid crystal; mass spectrometry; predictive model; standard; weight; breast milk; chemistry; female; infant; pollutant; Health risks",
Remarkable Contamination of Short- and Medium-Chain Chlorinated Paraffins in Free-Range Chicken Eggs from Rural Tibetan Plateau,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c08815,"Rapid social-economic development introduces modern lifestyles into rural areas, not only bringing numerous modern products but also new pollutants, such as chlorinated paraffins (CPs). The rural Tibetan Plateau has limited industrial activities and is a unique place to investigate this issue. Herein we collected 90 free-range chicken egg pool samples across the rural Tibetan Plateau to evaluate the pollution status of CPs. Meanwhile, CPs in related soils, free-range chicken eggs from Jiangxi, and farmed eggs from markets were also analyzed. The median concentrations of SCCPs (159 ng g-1 wet weight (ww)) and MCCPs (1390 ng g-1 ww) in Tibetan free-range chicken eggs were comparable to those from Jiangxi (259 and 938 ng g-1 ww) and significantly higher than those in farmed eggs (22.0 and 81.7 ng g-1 ww). In the rural Tibetan Plateau, the median EDI of CPs via egg consumption by adults and children were estimated to be 81.6 and 220.2 ng kg-1 bw day-1 for SCCPs and 483.4 and 1291 ng kg-1 bw day-1 for MCCPs, respectively. MCCPs might pose potential health risks for both adults and children in the worst scenario. Our study demonstrates that new pollutants should not be ignored and need further attention in remote rural areas. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Animals; Chickens; Child; China; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Paraffin; Tibet; China; Jiangxi; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Animals; Health risks; Paraffins; Risk perception; paraffin; chlorinated hydrocarbon; paraffin; Chicken eggs; Chlorinated paraffins; Egg; Jiangxi; Medium-chain chlorinated paraffins; New pollutant; Rural tibetan plateau; Short-chain chlorinated paraffins; Tibetan Plateau; Wet weight; egg; egg production; health risk; lifestyle; pollution effect; rural area; adult; Article; atmospheric transport; body weight; child; chlorination; concentration (parameter); controlled study; economic development; egg; estimated daily intake; food contamination; food safety; Gallus gallus; gross national product; health hazard; human; human impact (environment); Monte Carlo method; no-observed-adverse-effect level; nonhuman; persistent organic pollutant; pollution; risk assessment; rural area; Tibet; animal; China; environmental monitoring; Gallus gallus; pollutant; Tibet; Rural areas",
"Concentrations of 45 Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in North American River Otters (Lontra canadensis) from West Virginia, USA",2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c09467,"North American river otters (Lontra canadensis) are top predators in riverine ecosystems and are vulnerable to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure. Little is known about the magnitude of exposure and tissue distribution of PFAS in river otters. We measured 45 PFAS in various tissues of 42 river otters collected from several watersheds in the state of West Virginia, USA. The median concentrations of ¡ÆAll (sum concentration of 45 PFAS) varied among tissues in the following decreasing order: liver (931 ng/g wet weight) > bile > pancreas > lung > kidney > blood > brain > muscle. Perfluoroalkylsulfonates (PFSAs) were the predominant compounds accounting for 58-75% of the total concentrations, followed by perfluoroalkyl carboxylates (PFCAs; 21-35%). 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (8:2 FTS), 10:2 FTS, and 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate were frequently found in the liver (50-90%) and bile (96-100%), whereas hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) was rarely found. The hepatic concentrations of ¡ÆAll in river otters collected downstream of a fluoropolymer production facility located along the Ohio River were 2-fold higher than those in other watersheds. The median whole body burden of ¡ÆAll was calculated to be 1580 ¦Ìg. PFOS and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) concentrations in whole blood of some river otters exceeded the human toxicity reference values, which warrant further studies. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Animals; Ecosystem; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Liver; Otters; Water Pollutants, Chemical; West Virginia; Ohio River; United States; West Virginia; Blood; Carboxylation; Histology; Rivers; Tissue; carbon; functional group; perfluoro compound; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanoic acid; fluorocarbon; Body burden; Lontra canadensis; North American; Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; River otter; Sulphonates; Time trends; Tissue distributions; West Virginia; blood; brain; concentration (composition); mammal; muscle; oxide group; sulfonate; toxicity; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bile; biological monitoring; body burden; geographic distribution; immunotoxicity; liver; Lontra canadensis; metabolic disorder; nonhuman; North American; Ohio; persistent organic pollutant; predator; reference value; river; tissue distribution; United States; watershed; West Virginia; animal; ecosystem; human; otter; water pollutant; Watersheds",
Novel Defluorination Pathways of Perfluoroether Compounds (GenX): ¦Á-Fe2O3 Nanoparticle Layer Retains Higher Concentrations of Effective Hydrated Electrons,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c09879,"The development of efficient defluorination technology is an important issue because the kind of emerging pollutant of hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) as an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has the higher environmental risks. In the UV/bisulfite system, we first developed a hydrophobic confined ¦Á-Fe2O3 nanoparticle layer rich in oxygen vacancies, which accelerated the enrichment of HSO3- and GenX on the surface and pores through electrostatic attraction and hydrophobic interaction, retaining more hydrated electrons (eaq-) and rapidly destroying GenX under UV excitation. Especially, under anaerobic and aerobic conditions, the degradation percentage of GenX obtain nearly 100%, defluorination of GenX to 88 and 57% respectively. It was amazed to find that the three parallel H/F exchange pathways triggered by the rapid reactions of eaq- and GenX, which were unique to anaerobic conditions, improved the efficiency of fluoride removal and weaken the interference of dissolved oxygen and H+. Therefore, this study provided an available material and mechanism for sustainable fluoride removal from wastewater in aerobic and anaerobic conditions. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.",Environmental technology; Fluorine compounds; Hematite; Hydration; Hydrophobicity; Nanoparticles; bisulfite; dimer; dissolved oxygen; fluoride; nanoparticle; oxygen; perfluorooctanoic acid; Anaerobic conditions; Defluorination; Defluorination mechanism; Degradation pathways; Fluoride removal; Genx; Hydrated electron; Hydrophobic confinement; Hydrophobic confinement structure; Nanoparticle layers; anoxic conditions; degradation; electron; fluoride; fluorine; iron oxide; nanoparticle; oxic conditions; oxygen; pollutant removal; polymer; wastewater; article; controlled study; defluorination; degradation; electron; environmental risk; excitation; signal transduction; ultraviolet radiation; Dissolved oxygen,
Perfluorooctanesulfonic Acid Alters the Plant¡¯s Phosphate Transport Gene Network and Exhibits Antagonistic Effects on the Phosphate Uptake,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c10930,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), with significant health risks to humans and wildlife, bioaccumulate in plants. However, the mechanisms underlying plant uptake remain poorly understood. This study deployed transcriptomic analysis coupled with genetic and physiological studies using Arabidopsis to investigate how plants respond to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a long-chain PFAS. We observed increased expressions of genes involved in plant uptake and transport of phosphorus, an essential plant nutrient, suggesting intertwined uptake and transport processes of phosphorus and PFOS. Furthermore, PFOS-altered response differed from the phosphorus deficiency response, disrupting phosphorus metabolism to increase phosphate transporter (PHT) transcript. Interestingly, pht1;2 and pht1;8 mutants showed reduced sensitivity to PFOS compared to that of the wild type, implying an important role of phosphate transporters in PFOS sensing. Furthermore, PFOS accumulated less in the shoots of the pht1;8 mutant, indicating the involvement of PHT1;8 protein in translocating PFOS from roots to shoots. Supplementing phosphate improved plant¡¯s tolerance to PFOS and reduced PFOS uptake, suggesting that manipulating the phosphate source in PFOS-contaminated soils may be a promising strategy for minimizing PFOS uptake by edible crops or promoting PFOS uptake during phytoremediation. This study highlighted the critical role of phosphate sensing and transport system in the uptake and translocation of PFOS in plants. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.",Bioremediation; Health risks; Soil pollution; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; phosphate; phosphate transporter; phosphorus; Gene networks; Perfluorooctanesulphonic acid; Phosphate deficiency; Phosphate transport; Phosphate transporters; Phytoremediation; Plant uptake; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Transcriptomic analyse; Transcriptomics; antagonistic effect; Arabidopsis; article; controlled study; gene regulatory network; health hazard; human; nonhuman; phosphate deficiency; phosphate metabolism; phosphate transport; phytoremediation; plant nutrient; shoot; wild type; Genes,
PFASs in Cerebrospinal Fluids and Blood-CSF Barrier Permeability in Patients with Cognitive Impairment,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c10511,"Attention has been drawn to the associations between PFASs and human cognitive decline. However, knowledge on the occurrence and permeability of PFASs in the brains of patients with cognitive impairment has not been reported. Here, we determined 30 PFASs in paired sera and cerebrospinal fluids (CSFs) from patients with cognitive impairment (n = 41) and controls without cognitive decline (n = 18). We revealed similar serum PFAS levels but different CSF PFAS levels, with lower CSF PFOA (median: 0.125 vs 0.303 ng/mL, p < 0.05), yet higher CSF PFOS (0.100 vs 0.052 ng/mL, p < 0.05) in patients than in controls. Blood-brain transfer rates also showed lower RCSF/Serum values for PFOA and higher RCSF/Serum values for PFOS in patients, implying potential heterogeneous associations with cognitive function. The RCSF/Serum values for C4-C14 perfluoroalkyl carboxylates exhibited a U-shape trend with increasing chain length. Logistic regression analyses demonstrated that CSF PFOS levels were linked to the heightened risk of cognitive impairment [odds ratio: 3.22 (1.18-11.8)] but not for serum PFOS. Toxicity inference results based on the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database suggested that PFOS in CSF may have a greater potential to impair human cognition than other PFASs. Our results contribute to a better understanding of brain PFAS exposure and its potential impact on cognitive function. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Alkanesulfonic Acids; Carboxylic Acids; Cognitive Dysfunction; Environmental Pollutants; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Permeability; Blood; Carboxylation; Cerebrospinal fluid; Regression analysis; 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate; 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate; 8:2 fluorotelomer acid; 8:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate; 8:2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diester; alkyl group; carboxylic acid; dodecafluoro 3h 4,8 dioxanonanoate; fluorine derivative; hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid; n ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamide; n ethylperfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetate; n methylperfluorooctane sulfonamide; n methylperfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetate; organophosphate; perfluoroalkanoic acid; perfluorobutanesulfonic acid; perfluorobutanoic acid; perfluorodecanesulfonic acid; perfluorodecanoic acid; perfluorododecanoic acid; perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid; perfluoroheptanoic acid; perfluorohexadecanoic acid; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorohexanoic acid; perfluorononanoic acid; perfluorooctadecanoic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; perfluoropentanoic acid; perfluorotetradecanoic acid; perfluorotridecanoic acid; perfluoroundecanoic acid; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; Blood-cerebrospinal fluid-barrier; Cognitive decline; Cognitive functions; Cognitive impairment; In-control; Lowest R; PFAS; PFOS; Transfer rates; U shape; body fluid; brain; cognition; health impact; health risk; serum; adult; alcohol consumption; Article; bioaccumulation; blood cerebrospinal fluid barrier; blood level; cerebrospinal fluid; cognition; cognitive defect; controlled study; environmental exposure; female; human; hypertension; learning disorder; limit of detection; male; memory disorder; mental disease; middle aged; neurotoxicity; cognitive defect; permeability; pollutant; Brain",
Changes in Concentrations of Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in Human Milk Over Lactation Time and Effects of Maternal Exposure via Analysis of Matched Samples,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c09896,"Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are potentially related to many adverse health outcomes and could be transferred from maternal blood to human milk, which is an important exposure source for infants during a long-term period. In this study, the maternal blood of 76 women after delivery and their matched human milk samples obtained at 0.5, 1, and 3 months were analyzed by solid-phase extraction method with metal?organic framework/polymer hybrid nanofibers as the sorbents and ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography-negative electrospray ionization mass spectrometric for quantitative analysis of 31 PFAS. The perfluorooctanoic acid, perfluorooctane sulfonate, and N-methyl perfluorooctane sulfonamido acetic acid (N-MeFOSAA) contributed to more than approximately 50% of the total PFAS concentrations in blood and human milk, while N-MeFOSAA (median: 0.274 ng/mL) was the highest PFAS in human milk at 3 months. The transfer efficiencies for PFAS from maternal blood to human milk at 0.5 months were generally lower, with medians ranging from 0.20% to 16.9%.

Integrated Analysis of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substance Exposure and Metabolic Profiling of Elderly Residents Living near Industrial Plants,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c09014,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely used in industrial production, causing potential health risks to the residents living around chemical industrial plants; however, the lack of data on population exposure and adverse effects impedes our understanding and ability to prevent risks. In this study, we performed screening and association analysis on exogenous PFAS pollutants and endogenous small-molecule metabolites in the serum of elderly residents living near industrial plants. Exposure levels of 11 legacy and novel PFASs were determined. PFOA and PFOS were major contributors, and PFNA, PFHxS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA also showed high detection frequencies. Association analysis among PFASs and 287 metabolites identified via non-target screening was performed with adjustments of covariates and false discovery rate. Strongly associated metabolites were predominantly lipid and lipid-like molecules. Steroid hormone biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and fatty-acid-related pathways, including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid metabolism, ¦Á-linolenic acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis, were enriched as the metabolic pathways associated with mixed exposure to multiple PFASs, providing metabolic explanation and evidence for the potential mediating role of adverse health effects as a result of PFAS exposure.

Prediction of the Interactions of a Large Number of Per- and Poly-Fluoroalkyl Substances with Ten Nuclear Receptors,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c05974,"Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent, toxic chemicals that pose significant hazards to human health and the environment. Screening large numbers of chemicals for their ability to act as endocrine disruptors by modulating the activity of nuclear receptors (NRs) is challenging because of the time and cost of in vitro and in vivo experiments. For this reason, we need computational approaches to screen these chemicals and quickly prioritize them for further testing. Here, we utilized molecular modeling and machine-learning predictions to identify potential interactions between 4545 PFASs with ten different NRs. The results show that some PFASs can bind strongly to several receptors. Further, PFASs that bind to different receptors can have very different structures spread throughout the chemical space. Biological validation of these in silico findings should be a high priority. ? 2024 The Authors.

"Suspect, Nontarget Screening, and Toxicity Prediction of Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances in the Landfill Leachate",2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c07533,"Landfills are the final stage of urban wastes containing perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs in the landfill leachate may contaminate the surrounding groundwater. As major environmental pollutants, emerging PFASs have raised global concern. Besides the widely reported legacy PFASs, the distribution and potential toxic effects of numerous emerging PFASs remain unclear, and unknown PFASs still need discovery and characterization. This study proposed a comprehensive method for PFAS screening in leachate samples using suspect and nontarget analysis. A total of 48 PFASs from 10 classes were identified; nine novel PFASs including eight chloroperfluoropolyether carboxylates (Cl-PFPECAs) and bistriflimide (HNTf2) were reported for the first time in the leachate, where Cl-PFPECA-3,1 and Cl-PFPECA-2,2 were first reported in environmental media. Optimized molecular docking models were established for prioritizing the PFASs with potential activity against peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ¦Á and estrogen receptor ¦Á. Our results indicated that several emerging PFASs of N-methyl perfluoroalkyl sulfonamido acetic acids (N-MeFASAAs), n:3 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (n:3 FTCA), and n:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (n:2 FTSA) have potential health risks that cannot be ignored. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Alkanesulfonates; Carboxylic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Molecular Docking Simulation; Waste Disposal Facilities; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Carboxylation; Cells; Cytology; Health risks; Leachate treatment; Molecular modeling; Solvents; Toxicity; alkanesulfonic acid; carboxylic acid; fluorocarbon; Cl-PFPECA; Environmental pollutants; Landfill leachates; Molecular docking; Non-target screenings; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Toxic effect; Toxicity predictions; Urban wastes; carboxylic acid; landfill; leachate; sulfonate; toxicity; analysis; molecular docking; waste disposal facility; water pollutant; Groundwater",
Assessment of Potential Accumulation of Trifluoroacetate in Terminal Lakes,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c08822,"Trifluoroacetate (TFA) is the anionic form of the shortest perfluorocarboxylic acid (PFCA) and is ubiquitous in the environment at concentrations that are typically much higher than those of other PFCAs. As a stable and nonvolatile anion, it is expected to accumulate in terminal lakes in endorheic basins. This research sampled eight terminal lakes in the Western United States to determine the degree to which TFA is concentrating in these lakes and compare the data to samples collected from three of these lakes 25 years ago. The first observation was that three of the six terminal lakes sampled had higher TFA concentrations than their input streams, while the last two lakes lacked surface water inputs at the sampling time. The TFA concentrations in Mono Lake effectively remained constant over 25 years despite the input stream concentrations increasing 6.5-fold. In contrast, Pyramid Lake concentrations increased approximately the expected amount based on a simplistic analysis of input flows and concentrations.

Effects of Halides on Organic Compound Degradation during Plasma Treatment of Brines,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c07162,"Plasma has been proposed as an alternative strategy to treat organic contaminants in brines. Chemical degradation in these systems is expected to be partially driven by halogen oxidants, which have been detected in halide-containing solutions exposed to plasma. In this study, we characterized specific mechanisms involving the formation and reactions of halogen oxidants during plasma treatment. We first demonstrated that addition of halides accelerated the degradation of a probe compound known to react quickly with halogen oxidants (i.e., para-hydroxybenzoate) but did not affect the degradation of a less reactive probe compound (i.e., benzoate). This effect was attributed to the degradation of para-hydroxybenzoate by hypohalous acids, which were produced via a mechanism involving halogen radicals as intermediates. We applied this mechanistic insight to investigate the impact of constituents in brines on reactions driven by halogen oxidants during plasma treatment. Bromide, which is expected to occur alongside chloride in brines, was required to enable halogen oxidant formation, consistent with the generation of halogen radicals from the oxidation of halides by hydroxyl radical. Other constituents typically present in brines (i.e., carbonates, organic matter) slowed the degradation of organic compounds, consistent with their ability to scavenge species involved during plasma treatment. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Halogens; Hydroxybenzoates; Hydroxyl Radical; Organic Chemicals; Oxidants; Oxidation-Reduction; Salts; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Chlorine compounds; Halogenation; Organic compounds; Plasma applications; Probes; 4 hydroxybenzoic acid; benzoic acid; bromide; halide; halogen; hydroxyl radical; natural organic matter; nitrogen; organic compound; oxidizing agent; oxygen; paracetamol; radical; reactive nitrogen species; sulfamethoxazole; brine; hydroxybenzoic acid derivative; organic compound; oxidizing agent; sodium chloride; Brine treatment; Chemical degradation; Exposed to; Halide; Halogen radical; Hydroxyl radicals; Hypohalous acids; Mechanistics; Organic contaminant; Plasma treatment; biodegradation; brine; chloride; halogen; oxidant; plasma; Article; conductance; controlled study; degradation; ionic strength; rate constant; spectroscopy; chemistry; oxidation reduction reaction; water pollutant; Oxidants",
Bioretention Design Modifications Increase the Simulated Capture of Hydrophobic and Hydrophilic Trace Organic Compounds,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c10375,"Stormwater rapidly moves trace organic contaminants (TrOCs) from the built environment to the aquatic environment. Bioretention cells reduce loadings of some TrOCs, but they struggle with hydrophilic compounds. Herein, we assessed the potential to enhance TrOC removal via changes in bioretention system design by simulating the fate of seven high-priority stormwater TrOCs (e.g., PFOA, 6PPD-quinone, PAHs) with log KOC values between ?1.5 and 6.74 in a bioretention cell. We evaluated eight design and management interventions for three illustrative use cases representing a highway, a residential area, and an airport. We suggest two metrics of performance: mass advected to the sewer network, which poses an acute risk to aquatic ecosystems, and total mass advected from the system, which poses a longer-term risk for persistent compounds. The optimized designs for each use case reduced effluent loadings of all but the most polar compound (PFOA) to <5% of influent mass. Our results suggest that having the largest possible system area allowed bioretention systems to provide benefits during larger events, which improved performance for all compounds. To improve performance for the most hydrophilic TrOCs, an amendment like biochar was necessary; field-scale research is needed to confirm this result. Our results showed that changing the design of bioretention systems can allow them to effectively capture TrOCs with a wide range of physicochemical properties, protecting human health and aquatic species from chemical impacts. ? 2024 The Authors.

"Bioaccumulation and Male Reproductive Toxicity of the New Brominated Flame Retardant Tetrabromobisphenol A-Bis(2,3-dibromo-2-methylpropyl ether) in Comparison with Hexabromocyclododecane",2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c10560,"Tetrabromobisphenol A-bis(2,3-dibromo-2-methylpropyl ether) (TBBPA-DBMPE) has come into use as an alternative to hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD), but it is unclear whether TBBPA-DBMPE has less hazard than HBCD. Here, we compared the bioaccumulation and male reproductive toxicity between TBBPA-DBMPE and HBCD in mice following long-term oral exposure after birth. We found that the concentrations of TBBPA-DBMPE in livers significantly increased with time, exhibiting a bioaccumulation potency not substantially different from HBCD. Lactational exposure to 1000 ¦Ìg/kg/d TBBPA-DBMPE as well as 50 ¦Ìg/kg/d HBCD inhibited testis development in suckling pups, and extended exposure up to adulthood resulted in significant molecular and cellular alterations in testes, with slighter effects of 50 ¦Ìg/kg/d TBBPA-DBMPE. When exposure was extended to 8 month age, severe reproductive impairments including reduced sperm count, increased abnormal sperm, and subfertility occurred in all treated animals, although 50 ¦Ìg/kg/d TBBPA-DBMPE exerted lower effects than 50 ¦Ìg/kg/d HBCD. Altogether, all data led us to conclude that TBBPA-DBMPE exerted weaker male reproductive toxicity than HBCD at the same doses but exhibited bioaccumulation potential roughly equivalent to HBCD. Our study fills the data gap regarding the bioaccumulation and toxicity of TBBPA-DBMPE and raises concerns about its use as an alternative to HBCD. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Animals; Bioaccumulation; Ether; Ethers; Ethyl Ethers; Flame Retardants; Hydrocarbons, Brominated; Male; Mice; Polybrominated Biphenyls; Semen; Bioaccumulation; Biochemistry; Flame retardants; Mammals; Toxicity; bromine; ether; flame retardant; hexabromocyclododecane; messenger RNA; testosterone; tetrabromobisphenol A; brominated hydrocarbon; ether; ether derivative; flame retardant; hexabromocyclododecane; polybrominated biphenyl; tetrabromobisphenol A; Brominated flame retardants; Cellulars; Hexabromocyclododecanes; Lactational exposure; Oral exposure; POP; Reproductive toxicities; Testis; Tetrabromobisphenol A-bis(2,3-dibromo-2-methylpropyl ether); Tetrabromobisphenol-A; bioaccumulation; flame retardant; hormone; sperm; toxicity; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; bioaccumulation; body weight; comparative study; controlled study; experimental design; female; germ cell; lactational exposure; liver tissue; liver weight; long term exposure; male; marker gene; morphology; mouse; nonhuman; occupational exposure; progeny; reproductive toxicity; RNA sequencing; semen abnormality; Sertoli cell; sex ratio; sperm count; spermatocyte; spermatogonium; spermatozoon; subfertility; suckling animal; testis atrophy; testis development; testis weight; testosterone blood level; animal; bioaccumulation; sperm; Ethers",
Bioaccumulation and Potential Endocrine Disruption Risk of Legacy and Emerging Organophosphate Esters in Cetaceans from the Northern South China Sea,2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c09590,"Despite the increasing health risks shown by the continuous detection of organophosphate esters (OPEs) in biota in recent years, information on the occurrence and potential risks of OPEs in marine mammals remains limited. This study conducted the first investigation into the body burdens and potential risks of 10 traditional OPEs (tOPEs) and five emerging OPEs (eOPEs) in 10 cetacean species (n = 84) from the northern South China Sea (NSCS) during 2005-2021. All OPEs, except for 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPHP), were detected in these cetaceans, indicating their widespread occurrence in the NSCS. Although the levels of the ¡Æ10tOPEs in humpback dolphins remained stable from 2005 to 2021, the concentrations of the ¡Æ5eOPEs showed a significant increase, suggesting a growing demand for these new-generation OPEs in South China. Dolphins in proximity to urban regions generally exhibited higher OPE concentrations than those from rural areas, mirroring the environmental trends of OPEs occurring in this area. All OPE congeners, except for EHDPHP, in humpback dolphins exhibited a maternal transfer ratio >1, indicating that the dolphin placenta may not be an efficient barrier for OPEs. The observed significant correlations between levels of OPEs and hormones (triiodothyronine, thyroxine, and testosterone) in humpback dolphins indicated that OPE exposures might have endocrine disruption effects on the dolphin population. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.",Animals; Bioaccumulation; China; Dolphins; Environmental Monitoring; Esters; Flame Retardants; Organophosphates; Phosphates; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Biochemistry; Dolphins (structures); Endocrine disrupters; Endocrinology; Esters; Health risks; Mammals; ester; flame retardant; organophosphate; phosphate; Cetacean; Continuous detections; Endocrine disrupting chemicals; Endocrine disruption; Humpback dolphins; Marine mammals; Maternal transfer; Northern South China Sea; Organophosphate esters; Potential risks; bioaccumulation; dolphin; endocrine disruptor; hormone; organophosphate; animal; bioaccumulation; China; environmental monitoring; toothed whale; Hormones,
"Assessment of Fetal Exposure and Elimination of Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances: New Evidence from Paired Serum, Placenta, and Meconium Samples",2024,10.1021/acs.est.3c08498,"Multiple pieces of evidence have shown that prenatal exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) is closely related to adverse birth outcomes for infants. However, difficult access to human samples limits our understanding of PFASs transport and metabolism across the human placental barrier, as well as the accurate assessment of fetal PFASs exposure. Herein, we assess fetal exposure to 28 PFASs based on paired serum, placenta, and meconium samples. Overall, 21 PFASs were identified first to be exposed to the fetus prenatally and to be metabolized and excreted by the fetus. In meconium samples, 25 PFASs were detected, with perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid being the dominant congeners, suggesting the metabolism and excretion of PFASs through meconium. Perfluoroalkyl sulfonic acids might be more easily eliminated through the meconium than perfluorinated carboxylic acids. Importantly, based on molecular docking, MRP1, OATP2B1, ASCT1, and P-gp were identified as crucial transporters in the dynamic placental transfer of PFASs between the mother and the fetus. ATSC5p and PubchemFP679 were recognized as critical structural features that affect the metabolism and secretion of PFASs through meconium. With increasing carbon chain length, both the transplacental transfer efficiency and meconium excretion efficiency of PFASs showed a structure-dependent manner. This study reports, for the first time, that meconium, which is a noninvasive and stable biological matrix, can be strong evidence of prenatal PFASs exposure. ? 2024 American Chemical Society.","Alkanesulfonic Acids; Carboxylic Acids; Female; Fluorocarbons; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Meconium; Molecular Docking Simulation; Placenta; Pregnancy; Efficiency; carboxylic acid; multidrug resistance associated protein 1; organic anion transporter B; peptides and proteins; perfluorohexanesulfonic acid; perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; protein asct1; sulfonic acid derivative; unclassified drug; alkanesulfonic acid; fluorocarbon; Elimination; Enterohepatic circulation; Exposed to; Meconia; Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance; Perfluoroalkyl substances; Polyfluoroalkyl substances; Prenatal exposure; Substance transport; Transporter; chemical substance; concentration (composition); excretion; metabolism; sampling; serum; sulfonate; Article; blood sampling; controlled study; electrospray mass spectrometry; female; human; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; maternal serum; meconium; molecular docking; multiple reaction monitoring; negative ion electrospray; placenta; placental transfer; positive ion electrospray; prenatal exposure; triple quadrupole mass spectrometry; ultra performance liquid chromatography; umbilical cord blood; metabolism; newborn; pregnancy; Metabolism",
